# product-app-with-go
A basic product app implementation to understand basic principles of go, crud development, rest api etc. under the guidance of "Mustafa Murat Co≈ükun".
I experienced Channels, Go routines and other language features in the Go language. Next, I developed a REST API using Docker and PostgreSQL.
I tried to strengthen each layer with integration and unit tests and tried to implement the layered architecture from start to finish.
